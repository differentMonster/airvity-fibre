## Introduction

Airvity Ecommerce

## Key Principles

-   Lean
-   Agile requirements flow

## Project MVP - Design Decisions

## Maintainability

-   [x] We prioritize productivity and time to market, so we plan to use Rails since the team is familiar with the technology even if it might be suboptimal.
-   [x] automated tests only at login and cart checkout because of lack of time and money for the MVP

## Scalability

-   [x] We expect from 500-2000 active users using our systems daily. This should be easily achievable with a modest deployment in Google Cloud and Kubernetes.

## Performance

-   [x] We want to have < 1s response times on every page in our system

## Fault-Tolerance

## Security

-   [x] Our systems should restart automatically in case of a failure. We plan to use Docker and Kubernetes.
