## Key Principles

-   Lean
-   Agile requirements flow

## Project MVP - Design Decisions

## Maintainability

-   [x] We prioritize productivity and time to market, so we plan to use Rails since the team is familiar with the technology even if it might be suboptimal.
-   [x] automated tests only at login and cart checkout because of lack of time and money for the MVP

## Scalability

## Performance
